## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How long does deployment take?

**A:** About 3-5 minutes with automated deploy. The first deployment takes longest because Render needs to build the website. Subsequent updates are faster.

### Q: Can I make changes after deployment?

**A:** Yes! Click the "Lovable URL" link, make changes, and click "Publish to GitHub" again. The system will automatically update the live website.

### Q: What if the customer doesn't like the AI-generated website?

**A:** You can make unlimited edits in Lovable before publishing. The AI does a great job, but you have full control to customize everything.

### Q: Do I need to know GitHub or coding?

**A:** No! The system handles all the technical parts automatically. You just need to click buttons and share the final website link.

### Q: What if automated deploy fails?

**A:** Use the "Manual Deploy" option as a fallback. It requires a few extra steps (copying and pasting the GitHub URL), but still works great.

### Q: Can I deploy multiple websites for the same business?

**A:** Yes, but each deployment creates a new website. If the customer wants to replace their existing website, deploy again with the same package.

### Q: How do I handle refunds?

**A:** Contact your manager or technical support. The dashboard doesn't handle refunds - you'll need to process them through your payment processor.

### Q: What happens if Render deployment fails?

**A:** The system will automatically retry up to 3 times. If it still fails, you'll see an error message with instructions. Contact technical support for help.
